Dear Michael and Daniel,

My name is Francesco Merletti and I'm the developer working on the COMTRADE data visualization for BIS here in London. I'm working closely with Julian, Nikos and Hiren.
First of all thanks for your support in this development and the amazing work on the API and documentation. I've found my way around quite easily.
We've done a first beta of the data visualization and in the process I've gathered a few technical questions and suggestions.

CORS
I've noticed that CORS is not enabled for:
* reporterAreas.json (http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/reporterAreas.json)
* partnerAreas.json (http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/partnerAreas.json)
* classificationHS.json (http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/classificationHS.json).
I will serve them off our own domain for now but it would be nice to query it directly from comtrade.un.org in the future.

The classificationHS.json JSON file
I've made a filtered version of http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/classificationHS.json with only AG2 values as these will be the ones used in our visualization. As a suggestion for the future it would be great if you offered cached JSON files at a specific code detail level (e.g. AG2, AG3...). The whole set is 800k and select2 slows down.
I've also noticed that some fields appear to be truncated. See for example:
{
    "id": "03",
    "text": "03 - Fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ne",
    "parent": "TOTAL"
}

Country codes
Since we will be displaying data on a choropleth using D3js (as I'm sure others may want to do in the future) it would have been handy to have the country 3-digit ISO code in there too. I've built my own data tables for lookup but it would be great if these were provided in your database table in the future.

Query enhancements:
Perhaps allowing longer ranges of data to be returned with less fields or the ability to customize fields returned.


- Lifting limits to API?
- Requesting data for multiple years
- Filter by top X countries
