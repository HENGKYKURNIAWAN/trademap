Dear Michael and Daniel,

First of all thanks for your support in this and the amazing work on the API and documentation. I've done some testing and have gathered a few technical questions and suggestions while I plan out the development of our visualization.

CORS
I've noticed that CORS is not enabled for:
* reporterAreas.json (http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/reporterAreas.json)
* partnerAreas.json (http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/partnerAreas.json)
* classificationHS.json (http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/classificationHS.json).
I will serve them off our own domain for now but it would be better to query it directly from comtrade.un.org in the future.

Suggestions for the JSON files
For our needs it would have been great to have a version of classificationHS.json restricted to 2 digits as the whole set is 800k and select2 slows down.
Since we will be displaying data on a choropleth using d3js (as I'm sure others may want to do in the future) it would have been handy to have the country 3-digit ISO code in there too.
I've built my own data tables for lookup but it would be great if you could provide those as generated from your database table in the future.

Classification 
I'm using a list of classifications in the visualization and started from this file:
http://comtrade.un.org/data/cache/classificationHS.json
However I noticed that some fields seem to be truncated. See for example:
{
    "id": "03",
    "text": "03 - Fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ne",
    "parent": "TOTAL"
}
I've filtered the JSON to only AG2 values since we will only be using these in our visualization. As a suggestion for the future it would be great if you offered cached JSON files at a specific code detail level (e.g. AG2, AG3...)




- Lifting limits to API?
- Requesting data for multiple years
- Filter by top X countries
