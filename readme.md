## Trade Map Visualization

Tech notes

* bower.io is a quick command line tool to download dependencies. Third party libraries (jquery, d3 etc.) are placed in the scripts/libs folder as they are from github.
* The __old folder contains the initial visualization by ONS

Code style

* variables are preferably named using camelCase
* indenting is 2 spaces (no tabs)
